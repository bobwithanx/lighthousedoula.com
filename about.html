<p>I was born and raised in Michigan and lived there my entire life until April 2013, when I moved to Arizona to be near my son, daughter-in-law, and adorable granddaughter.</p>
<p>
I grew up around children and babies. When I was 5 years old, my mom started a daycare in our home and was still caring for children when I moved out and married. When my son was 8 years old, I started a daycare in my own home for about 6 years, during which time I cared for children and babies as young as 6 weeks old.</p>
<p>My gift for helping others became evident when I was a teenager. When I was 15, I started volunteering at a local hospital and spent time with the patients in the geriatric unit giving them some companionship as well as helping feed dinner to those who needed help. I knew then how rewarding it was to help others, and I never forgot the feeling I had when doing so and how much I liked it.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, I have played a part in the lives of many family members from the time they were born. Then in July 2012, I became a grandma for the first time and relished spending time with my wonderful granddaughter, watching her grow - and helping her parents!</p>
<p>I realized that I loved babies and helping others. So when I found out what it meant to be a postpartum doula, I knew that it was the perfect fit for me! I am excited to be living my passion and serving families so they can truly enjoy their early days of becoming this new version of themselves.
